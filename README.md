Basics of java


Java -


# What is Class?
-A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
- A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.

# What is Method?
-Now you will learn how to create your own methods with or without return values, invoke a method with or without parameters, and apply method abstraction in the program design.
-A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class which is different from languages like C, C++ and Python.

# What is variables?
-A variable is the name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
In Java, all the variables must be declared before use

-A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

Program - Write Program where we will use class, method,variables?

# What is Main Method?
-main method in Java is an standard method which is used by JVM to start execution of any Java program.

# What is parameterised method?
Passing by value means that, whenever a call to a method is made, the parameters are evaluated, and the result value is copied into a portion of memory. When the parameter is used inside the method, either for read or write, we are actually using the copy, not the original value which is unaffected by the operations inside the method.

On the other hand, when a programming language uses passing by reference, the changes over a parameter inside a method will affect the original value. This is because what the method is receiving is the reference, i.e the memory address, of the variable.

# difference between method and main method?
main method means start the program public class name(),
method means call the function and actuall passing parameters.

# why we use new keyword in java?
-new is a Java keyword. It creates a Java object and allocates memory for it on the heap. new is also used for array creation, as arrays are also objects.

Programs -
write program where we will call parameterised method by passsing parameter.
for example pass age to method.
